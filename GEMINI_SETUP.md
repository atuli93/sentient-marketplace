## 🔑 First, Grab Your Magic Key

Every AI needs a key to unlock its powers. Here’s how you get yours:

1. Go to [Google Maker Suite](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)  
2. Sign in with your Google account  
3. Hit **“Create API Key”**  
4. Pick a project, or create a new one if you don’t have one  
5. Copy the key somewhere safe  

> Think of this as your **chatbot’s personal password**. Keep it secret, keep it safe. 🗝️

---

## 🛠️ Next, Connect the Key

Open your project’s `.env` file and paste the key like so:

```env
# Gemini AI Free Tier
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

Pro tip: If you’re using Vite, ```.env.local``` works even better for privacy.

```bash
npm run dev
```
